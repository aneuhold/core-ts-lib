This is a library containing TypeScript that I am sharing among a few different projects.

## Usage

Primarily this package exports classes. For example to use the `DateService`

## Updating

1. Create a new branch locally
2. Make some changes, then run `yarn bump`
3. Push the branch up to a PR to make sure it passes checks
4. Once it passes checks, merge the PR and it will automatically get deployed.
